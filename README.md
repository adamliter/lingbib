# Lingbib

## Overview

Every linguist who is a user of (La)TeX currently has to create and maintain their own `.bib` file for references.
It would be much more efficient if we could all contribute to and use a single, comprehensive bibliographic database for the field of linguistics.
In addition to saving time for everyone, a collaborative approach would also help maximize the accuracy of the data.

This is what Lingbib is. Lingbib includes such a database, provided in BibLaTeX format (and in the future, the old BibTeX format), along with a system for...
* maintaining a copy of the master database on your local computer,
* syncing the master database with a personal database for use with JabRef, BibDesk, and similar tools,
* backing up your personal database remotely,
* contributing to the master database

We do this using the Git versional control system, but you don't need to know Git in order to use Lingbib as everything is coordinated using a simple command line helper program.


## Documentation

Further documentation, including setup instructions, is available on the [Lingbib wiki][wiki].


## Contributing

This project is currently in the alpha stage.
We are in particular need of contributions the bibliography so that it becomes large enough to be useful to general users.
We are also looking for maintainers to help handle submissions and test the system.
See the [wiki][wiki] for details.
