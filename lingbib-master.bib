    abstract        = {Singular predicative nominals in English generally require an indefinite article, while equivalent constructions in the Romance languages do not. We examine two sorts of predication constructions, primary predications and modificational predication, and show that English and Romance vary consistently in their need for overt Number. This difference is attributed to the Free Agr Parameter applied to the nominal domain, which allows Num to be missing in Romance when not semantically required, as in most predicative constructions. In post-copular primary predications, an indefinite article is required even in Romance, unless the predicate is a profession or a role. We argue that Num is required in non-role predications to avoid a theta-marking configuration, and when no Num is present, as in role predications, the noun has an eventive argument and theta marks the subject of the predication.},

    abstract        = {With the crystallization of the ``generative enterprise'' half a century ago, two concepts became salient: the initial state and final states of the language faculty, respectively, UG (the genetic component) and I-languages. Since then inquiry has gained far greater scope and depth. It has also led to sharpening of fundamental principles of language. At first, descriptive adequacy appeared to require rich and complex assumptions about UG. A primary goal has always been to overcome this deficiency. Core properties of concern have included compositionality, order, projection (labeling), and displacement. Early work assigned the first three to phrase structure rules and the last to the transformational component. Simplification of computational procedures suggests that compositionality and displacement (along with the ``copy theory'') fall together while order may be a reflex of sensorimotor externalization, conclusions that have far-reaching consequences. As for labeling, minimal computation restricts options to the few that have considerable empirical support.},
