@Thesis{                        abney1987:noun,
  abstract                    = {This dissertation is a defense of the hypothesis that the noun phrase is headed by a \textit{functional element} (i.e., ``non-lexical'' category) D, identied with the determiner. In this way, the structure of the noun phrase parallels that of the sentence, which is headed by Infl(ection), under assumptions now standard within the Government-Binding (GB) framework.\par The central empirical problem addressed is the question of the proper analysis of the so-called ``Poss-ing'' gerund in English. This construction possesses simultaneously many properties of sentences, and many properties of noun phrases. The problem of capturing this dual aspect of the Poss-ing construction is heightened by current restrictive views of X-bar theory, which, in particular, rule out the obvious structure for Poss-ing, [$_{\text{NP}}$ NP VP$_{\text{ing}}$], by virtue of its exocentricity.\par Consideration of languages in which nouns, even the most basic concrete nouns, show agreement (AGR) with their possessors, points to an analysis of the noun phrase as headed by an element similar to Infl, which provides a position for AGR; I call this Infl-like element ``D''. D and Infl belong to the class of non-lexical categories, which I prefer to call \textit{functional} categories. The analysis in which D heads the noun phrase I call the ``DP-analysis''.\par Importing the DP-analysis into English yields an immediate solution for the problem of the Poss-ing gerund: Poss-ing gerunds (and by extension, noun phrases generally) have a more sentence-like structure than hitherto thought, namely, [$_{\text{DP}}$ DP's D VP$_{\text{ing}}$]. (In non-gerundive noun phrases, ``VP'' is replaced by a projection of N. This projection of N, despite being a maximal X-bar projection corresponds to N-bar in the standard analysis.)\par Current trends in the treatment of minor categories---so-called ``non-lexical'' categories---lead to a similar conclusion. Until recently, minor categories like complementizers and modals had been treated as syncategorematic. Under current assumptions, however, they participate fully in the X-bar schema. In this way, two simplifications are achieved simultaneously: we eliminate syncategorematic elements, and we acquire an endocentric analysis of the sentence, which had been exceptional in being the only exocentric major category. To make these results fully general, we are led to treat the remaining syncategorematic elements---in particular, determiners in noun phrases and degree words in adjective phrases---as heads of full phrases. The analogy with complementizers and modals indicates that determiners and degree words should head noun phrases and adjective phrases, respectively. In other words, determiners are lexical instantiations of ``D'' in the same way that modals are lexical instantiations of Infl.\par However, despite the conceptual links, the question of the existence of a functional head of the noun phrase (the DP-analysis), and the question of the place of the determiner, are independent questions, and I treat them separately: Chapters One through Three are concerned predominantly with the former question, Chapter Four with the latter.\par Chapter One provides a brief introduction. In Chapter Two, I present the DP-analysis, motivating it by examining languages with agreement between noun and possessor. I also discuss issues raised by the DP-analysis, with emphasis on the parallelism between noun phrase and sentence hypothesized under the DP-analysis. In particular, I treat the question of PRO in the noun phrase; and I show that the numerous differences between sentence and noun phrase do not invalidate the parallelism of structure proposed under the DP-analysis. In Chapter Three I apply the analysis to the three gerundive constructions, Acc-ing, Poss-ing, and Ing-of. Finally, in Chapter Four, I turn to the question of whether the determiner is the lexical instantiation of D, the functional head of the noun phrase.},

  abstract                    = {With the crystallization of the ``generative enterprise'' half a century ago, two concepts became salient: the initial state and final states of the language faculty, respectively, UG (the genetic component) and I-languages. Since then inquiry has gained far greater scope and depth. It has also led to sharpening of fundamental principles of language. At first, descriptive adequacy appeared to require rich and complex assumptions about UG. A primary goal has always been to overcome this deficiency. Core properties of concern have included compositionality, order, projection (labeling), and displacement. Early work assigned the first three to phrase structure rules and the last to the transformational component. Simplification of computational procedures suggests that compositionality and displacement (along with the ``copy theory'') fall together while order may be a reflex of sensorimotor externalization, conclusions that have far-reaching consequences. As for labeling, minimal computation restricts options to the few that have considerable empirical support.},

@Thesis{                        munn1993:coordinate,
  abstract                    = {This thesis is concerned with developing a syntax for coordinate structures which is compatible with both syntactic behaviour of conjunction structures and with their semantics. It argues that coordinate structures are asymmetrical, hierarchical structures that conform with X-bar theory. The conjunction head projects a phrase which is adjoined to the first conjunct. This provides an account of a number of syntactic asymmetries in conjunct ordering including agreement and binding asymmetries and provides a principled analysis of Across-the-Board extraction as instances of parasitic gaps. It further argues that the Coordinate Structure Constraint cannot be a syntactic constraint, but rather must be a condition on conjoining identical semantic categories. This provides an account of unlike category coordination which is shown to be freely possible if semantic identity is preserved and no independent syntactic constraints are violated, a result which follows from the adjunct nature of the coordinate structure. In order to account for the semantic identity, it is proposed that at Logical Form, each conjunct is a predicate in an identification relation with the conjunction head, which raises to take scope over all the conjuncts. Assuming theta role assignment at LF, only the conjunction head receives a theta role; none of the conjuncts does. Because each conjunct is in a predication relation with the conjunction head at LF, the semantic identity constraint follows directly. The fact that the conjuncts do not receive a theta role accounts for their inability to to act as antecedents for reflexive binding and for fact that modal adverbs can appear inside conjoined NPs. The proposed analysis assimilates coordinate structures directly to plurals, and argues that a consequence of the proposed LF is that all natural language conjunction and disjunction is group forming rather than propositional. All semantic ambiguities between distributed and collective coordination can then be derived with the appropriate logical representation for plurals in general, rather than having a separate semantics altogether for coordination.},

We examine two sorts of predication constructions, primary predications and modificational predication, and show that English and Romance vary consistently in their need for overt Number. This difference is attributed to the Free Agr Parameter applied to the nominal domain, which allows Num to be missing in Romance when not semantically required, as in most predicative constructions. In post-copular primary predications, an indefinite article is required even in Romance, unless the predicate is a profession or a role. We argue that Num is required in non-role predications to avoid a theta-marking configuration, and when no Num is present, as in role predications, the noun has an eventive argument and theta marks the subject of the predication.},

The trilogy sets out to demonstrate that the explanation of linguistic competence should be shifted from lexical entries to syntactic structure, from the memorizing of listed information to the manipulation of grammatical rules. Its reformulation of how grammar and listed items interact has profound implications for linguistic, philosophical, and psychological theories about the human mind and language. The book departs from both constructional approaches to syntax and the long generative tradition that uses the word as the nucleus around which the syntax grows. It argues that the hierarchical, abstract structures of language are universal, not language specific, and that language variation emerges from the morphological and phonological properties of grammatical functors, or more specifically, inflection. This volume applies this approach to the construction of complex words. The book develops a new model of word formation, arguing that the basic building blocks of language are on the one hand rigid semantic and syntactic functions, and on the other hand, roots, which in themselves are but packets of phonological information, and are devoid of both meaning and grammatical properties of any kind. Within such a model, syntactic category, syntactic selection and argument structure are all mediated through syntactic structures projected from rigid functions, or alternatively, constructed through general combinatorial principles of syntax, such as Chomsky's Merge. The meaning of `words', in turn, does not involve the existence of lexemes, but rather the matching of a well-defined and phonologically articulated syntactic domain with conceptual Content, itself outside the domain of language as such. In a departure from most current models of syntax but in line with many philosophical traditions, then, the Exo-Skeletal model partitions `meaning' into formal functions, on the one hand, and Content, on the other hand. While the former are read off syntactico-semantic structures as is usually assumed, Content is crucially read off syntactico-phonological structures.},
